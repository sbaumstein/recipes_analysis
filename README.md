## Introduction
This project examines a recipe dataset containing nutritional and rating information. 
The central question is: **What is the relationship between calories and average ratings?**

- **Number of rows**: 83782  
- **Relevant columns**:  
  - `nutrition`: List of all recipes nutritional info (including calories)
  - `minutes`: Time required to prepare the recipe.  
  - `average_rating`: The average user rating for the recipe.

- **All columns**:  
  - 'name', 'id', 'minutes', 'contributor_id', 'submitted', 'tags',
       'nutrition', 'n_steps', 'steps', 'description', 'ingredients',
       'n_ingredients', 'average_rating'
       
## Data Cleaning
- Extracted calorie information from the nutrition column.
- Dropped rows where the calories, minutes were missing.
- Filtered  calorie values  to those <= 5000.
- Drop rows where average rating was missing.

Hereâ€™s a snapshot of the cleaned DataFrame:

|| name                    | id      | minutes | contributor_id | submitted   | ... |

## Framing a Prediction Problem

- **Prediction Problem:** Can we predict the average rating of a recipe based on its calorie content and the minutes needed to cook the recipe?
**Type of Prediction:** Regression

## Baseline Model
- **Features**:  
  - Quantitative: `calories`, `minutes`  
- **Encoding**: StandardScaler for quantitative variables.

- **Mean Squared Error**: 0.41306454697189354
- **R-squared**: -3.280752206569204e-05

## inal Model

### **Feature Engineering**
- Created two new features to enhance the predictive power of the model:
  - **Calories per Minute (`calories_per_minute`)**: Captures the intensity of calorie usage relative to time.
  - **Logarithm of Calories (`log_calories`)**: Accounts for the non-linear scaling of calories, potentially reducing skewness in the data.
  
These features were chosen to better represent the relationships within the dataset, as both `calories_per_minute` and `log_calories` align with how calorie usage scales with time and energy density.

### **Model Selection**
- **Algorithm**: Ridge Regression  
- **Hyperparameters**:  
  - `alpha`: 0.1 (controls regularization strength)  
  - Polynomial features: Degree = 2 (to capture non-linear relationships)  

GridSearchCV was used to tune hyperparameters by performing an exhaustive search over a parameter grid.

### **Performance Comparison**
- **Baseline Model**:
  - **Features Used**: `calories` and `minutes`  
  - **MSE**: 0.41306454697189354  

- **Final Model**:
  - **Features Used**: `calories_per_minute`, `log_calories`, and their polynomial expansions (degree=2)  
  - **MSE**: 0.4051743738813599
  - **R-squared**: 0.00141071065875098

### **Improvement**
- The final model showed a slight improvement in Mean Squared Error (MSE), reducing from **0.413** to **0.405**.  
- This improvement highlights the value of engineered features like `calories_per_minute` and `log_calories`, which provided a more nuanced understanding of the relationships in the data.  
- The polynomial expansions allowed the model to account for non-linear interactions, leading to better predictions.
